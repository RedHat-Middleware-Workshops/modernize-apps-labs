# Intro

This is a Spring Boot microservice that represents catalog information in a retail store. It uses the Fabric8 Maven Plugin to deploy to OpenShift.

# Running on OpenShift

You'll need to have access to an OpenShift cluster and the `oc` command line interface.

1. Login to OpenShift and create a new project

```
oc login
oc new-project demo
```

1. This demo requires a PostgreSQL database. Create one by using the following command:

```
oc new-app -e POSTGRESQL_USER=catalog \
             -e POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword \
             -e POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=catalog \
             openshift/postgresql:latest \
             --name=catalog-database
```
> **NOTE:** If you change the username and password you also need to update `src/main/fabric8/credential-secret.yml`.

> **NOTE:** If you change the database or application name app you also need update `src/main/resources/application-openshift.properties` as well.

2. Use the Fabric8 Maven Plugin to launch the S2I process on the OpenShift Online machine & start the pod.

```
mvn clean fabric8:deploy -Popenshift -DskipTests
```

This will build and deploy the microservice along with a Postgres database.

3. To test the service using curl:

```
curl http://catalog-<project>.<domain>/services/products
```
For example:

```
% curl http://catalog-lab5.apps.127.0.0.1.nip.io/services/products
